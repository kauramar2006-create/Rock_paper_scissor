# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissor Game

A simple **Rock-Paper-Scissor** game built using Python.  
This project allows a user to play against the computer until one of them reaches a target score defined by the player.


## 🚀 Features
- Play against the computer with randomized moves.
- User-friendly input system (case-insensitive).
- Quit option (`q`) at any time.
- Displays live scores after each round.
- Target score can be customized at the start of the game.
- Clear end-game messages (Win/Lose/Quit).


## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The player sets the **target points** required to win.
2. In each round:
   - The user inputs `rock`, `paper`, or `scissor`.
   - The computer randomly selects its move.
   - The winner of the round is decided based on the rules:
     - Rock beats Scissor  
     - Scissor beats Paper  
     - Paper beats Rock  
3. Scores are updated after each round.
4. The first to reach the target points is declared the winner.
